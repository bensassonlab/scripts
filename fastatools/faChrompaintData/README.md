# with the following command, faChrompaint, will create plots for each alignment in files that begin with 'chr'. 
# Each alignment will be broken into blocks of the default window size. 
# Pairwise differences in each block are summarized in P34048.pDiffs.tsv and the nearest other strain is identified in P34048.nearest.tsv
# each rectangle is colored according to the clade of the nearest sequence using the clade and color descriptions in 'clades' and 'colors'
# The -M option means that the maximum difference allowed in order to give a clade assignment is 0.00066 (ie 0.066%) because 90% of within-clade differences for these C. albicans data are below this value

faChrompaint.pl -I chr -r P34048 -c clades -C colors -M 0.00066 -e 'NCYC4146 1AA SC5314_A'

# to replot while only changing the colors of clades without the (slow) finding of most similar strains use the following command
# NOTE: the -p plotting mode does not allow changes to which strains are excluded from the analysis or changes to any other parameters used when generating the .nearest.tsv file

faChrompaint.pl -p P34048.nearest.tsv -c clades -C colors
