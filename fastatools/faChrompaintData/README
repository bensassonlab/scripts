# with the following command, faChrompaint, will create plots for each alignment in files that begin with 'chr'. 
# Each alignment will be broken into blocks of the default window size. 
# Pairwise differences in each block are summarized in P34048.pDiffs.tsv and the nearest other strain is identified in P34048.nearest.tsv
# each rectangle is colored according to the clade of the nearest sequence using the clade and color descriptions in 'clades' and 'colors'
# The -M option means that the maximum difference allowed in order to give a clade assignment is 0.00066 (ie 0.066%) because 90% of within-clade differences for these C. albicans data are below this value
